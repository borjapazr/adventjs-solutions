# Nobody wants to do extra hours at work

## ðŸ”¢ Instructions

A millionaire has bought a social network and it doesn't bring good news. He has announced that **each time a working day is lost due to a holiday**, it will have to be compensated with **two extra hours another day of the same year**.

Obviously the people who work in the company have not made the slightest joke and are **preparing a program that tells them the number of extra hours they would do** in the year if the new rule were applied.

Since it is office work, their working hours are **from Monday to Friday**. So you only have to worry about the holidays that fall on those days.

Given a year and an array with the dates of the holidays, return the number of extra hours that would be done that year:

```javascript
const year = 2022;
const holidays = ['01/06', '04/01', '12/25']; // format MM/DD

// 01/06 is January 6, Thursday. Count.
// 04/01 is April 1, Friday. Count.
// 12/25 is December 25, Sunday. Do not count.

countHours(year, holidays); // 2 days -> 4 extra hours in the year
```

**Things to keep in mind**:

- The year can be a leap year. Make the checks you need for it, if necessary.
- Although the holiday is December 31, the extra hours will be done the same year.
- `Date.getDay()` method returns the day of the week of a date. `0` is Sunday, `1` is Monday, etc.
