# How many packs of gifts can Santa carry?

## ðŸ”¢ Instructions

You receive a Christmas gifts pack that Santa Claus wants to deliver to the children. **Each gift inside the pack is represented by a string** and it has a weight equal to the number of letters in its name. Santa Claus's sleigh can only carry a **weight limit**.

Santa Claus also has a list of reindeer able to help him to deliver the gifts. Each reindeer has a **maximum weight limit** that it can carry. The maximum weight limit of each reindeer is **equal to twice the number of letters in its name**.

Your task is to implement a function `distributeGifts(packOfGifts, reindeers)` that receives a gifts pack and a list of reindeer and returns the maximum number of gifts packs that Santa Claus can deliver. **You can't split gifts packs**.

```javascript
const packOfGifts = ['book', 'doll', 'ball'];
const reindeers = ['dasher', 'dancer'];

// pack weights 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
// reindeers can carry (2 * 6) + (2 * 6) = 24
distributeGifts(packOfGifts, reindeers); // 2
```

**Things to keep in mind**:

- The gifts pack can't be splitted.
- Gifts and reindeers' names length will always be greater than 0.
