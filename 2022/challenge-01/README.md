# Automating Christmas gift wrapping!

## ðŸ”¢ Instructions

This year the elves have bought a gift wrapping machine. But... it's not programmed! **We need to create an algorithm that helps it in the task**.

The machine receives an array with the gifts. Each gift is a `string`. We need the machine to wrap each gift in wrapping paper and place it in an array of wrapped gifts.

The wrapping paper is the `*` symbol and to wrap a gift the `*` symbol is placed so that it completely surrounds the string on all sides. For example:

```javascript
const gifts = ['book', 'game', 'socks'];
const wrapped = wrapping(gifts);
console.log(wrapped);
/* [
  "******\n*book*\n******",
  "******\n*game*\n******",
  "*******\n*socks*\n*******"
] */
```

As you can see, the wrapping paper wraps the string. On top and bottom, so as not to leave any gaps, the corners are also covered with wrapping paper.

**Note**: `\n` is the character that represents a line break.

**Watch out!** Make sure you put the right number of \* to wrap completely the string.

**Good luck!**
