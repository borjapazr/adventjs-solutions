# The lights in sync

## ðŸ”¢ Instructions

Verify that all independent sequences of Christmas lighting systems are in strictly increasing order. We have two arrays: `systemNames` and `stepNumbers`.

`systemNames` contains the names of the Christmas lighting systems, and `stepNumbers` contains the step numbers of each system.

We must verify that the stepNumbers of each system are in strictly increasing order. If this is true, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

For example:

```javascript
const systemNames = ['tree_1', 'tree_2', 'house', 'tree_1', 'tree_2', 'house'];
const stepNumbers = [1, 33, 10, 2, 44, 20];

checkStepNumbers(systemNames, stepNumbers); // => true

// tree_1 has steps: [1, 2]
// tree_2 has steps: [33, 44]
// house has steps: [10, 20]

// true: The steps of each system are in strictly increasing order

checkStepNumbers(['tree_1', 'tree_1', 'house'], [2, 1, 10]); // => false

// tree_1 has steps: [2, 1]
// house has steps: [10]

// false: tree_1 has steps in decreasing order
```

**Note that**:

- The position of the system name in systemNames and the step number in stepNumbers correspond to the same system.
- The steps in stepNumbers can be repeated for different systems.
