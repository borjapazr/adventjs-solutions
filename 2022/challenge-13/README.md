# Backups for Santa Claus files

## 🔢 Instructions

To avoid losing data when the server crashes, Santa Claus has decided to make incremental backups. A hacker called S4vitelf is helping him.

On one hand, we have the **timestamp** of when the last backup was made.

We also have the changes that have been made in an array of arrays. Each internal array contains **two elements**: the **id** of the modified file and the **timestamp** of the modification.

You have to create a program that returns an array with the **id** of the files that we would have to make backup because they have been modified since the last backup and **sorted in ascending order**. Example:

```javascript
const lastBackup = 1546300800;

const changes = [
  [3, 1546301100],
  [2, 1546300800],
  [1, 1546300800],
  [1, 1546300900],
  [1, 1546301000]
];

getFilesToBackup(lastBackup, changes); // => [ 1, 3 ]
// The file with id 1 has been modified twice
// after the last backup.

// The file with id 2 has not been modified after
// the last backup.

// The file with id 3 has been modified once
// after the last backup.

// We have to make a backup
// of the files 1 and 3.
```

**Remember that**:

- Returns the id of the files that have been modified after the last backup.
- Returns an empty array if there are no files to make backup.
- Remember to sort ids in ascending order.
